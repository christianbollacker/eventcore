        <p>Hi Yaeka,</p>
        <p>Nice to ‘e-meet’ you. I’ve recently begun steering my career in a more suitable direction! I came across your job opening for a Web Producer, and it reads like the perfect role for me. My skills seamlessly transfer to the description you have posted, and I have included my resume and some sample projects on this site for your review.</p>
        <p>I am fortunate to have worked in production for most of my career, including Theater, Luxury Yachts, and most recently Web Development. Tracy mentioned you are looking for a Technical Wizard, and my experience clearly demonstrates I am a great problem-solver, team player, mastering various technologies along the way, while picking up new ones quickly. I have basic knowledge of HTML and CSS and rudimentary knowledge of SQL after completing a course through Code Fellows and I’m eager to learn more. As the Assistant Technical Director of the Seattle Rep Theater, I led a team of 6 carpenters, which involved a high-level of deadline-driven time management. My current role at Delta Marine requires communication between multiple stakeholders to ensure our end result balances client requirements with production schedules and budgets.</p>
        <p>The Web Producer role combines my passion for technology with my capabilities in production, and I am positive I would have the same success working with Eventcore that I’ve enjoyed throughout my career. I look forward to discussing any possibilities and appreciate your consideration.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Christian Bollacker</br>christianbollacker@outlook.com</br>206-518-4655</p>
